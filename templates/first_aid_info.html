    <h3>What Is First Aid?</h3><br>
    <h5>First aid is the initial assistance that it's given to somebody that is injured or has to become unwell until further medical assistance arrives. So, if that is you, make sure that first and foremost that you are not in any danger you are the most important person and make sure that there's no further danger to the casualty as well there are some priorities of first aid:</h5>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Why First Aid Works?</h3><br>
        <ul>
            <li>First Aid is essential to preserve life. Basically, this is what we want to achieve so we don't want anyone to die. Therefore, if we're going to get an AED and use that to do CPR everyone can see that's all going to help preserve life as well as holding the ambulance.</li><br>
            <li>Prevent it from getting any worse. That might be apply by applying direct pressure to an open wound, again sitting them down and down and raising their legs before they fall down, if they're feeling faint or anything like that.</li><br>
            <li>Promote recovery to promote recovery if a person has low blood sugar levels. Putting things in action as soon as possible helps them to go to hospital for recovery.</li>
            
            
        </ul>
        </div><br>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Before we start talking about the principles of First Aid, it should be noted that in every single case we're obliged to dial 112 (911) (Emergency Service).</h3><br>
        <h5>This is an essential factor for saving a person's life. We should call emergency service before starting a maneuver since it will save time. Time is the main "competitor" of saving a person's life, so putting things in action is mandatory.</h5>
        </div><br>
    
    <div class="container">
            <h3>DRCABD Acronym:</h3><br>
            <h5>D.R.C.A.B.D (Or in other cases, A.B.C.D.E) Acronym is commonly used when doing CPR. It helps people to memorize every single detail essential when saving a person's life. Let's look at the initials:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>D - Danger. This term is used to check whether a victim is in a safe place or not. For instance, if a person is injured and is near a fire, we don't do CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) there. Instead, we put ourselves and that person in a safe place and then we perform other actions followed by... </li><br>
                <li>R - Response. We check if that person is responsive or not. For instance, we can talk loudly to him if they respond to it by (Are you okay? Do you need some help?)</li><br>
                <li>C - Circulation. Assess the victim's circulation, including checking for signs of severe bleeding or shock. If there is significant bleeding, applying pressure to the wound can help control it until professional medical help arrives.</li><br>
                <li>A - Airway. Ensure the victim's airway is clear and open. Check for any blockages or obstructions that might prevent the person from breathing. If necessary, perform basic maneuvers to open the airway, such as the head-tilt chin-lift technique.</li><br>
                <li>B - Breathing. Check if the victim is breathing normally. Look, listen, and feel for breathing for about 10 seconds. If the person is not breathing, begin CPR starting with chest compressions and rescue breaths.</li><br>
                <li>D - Defibrillation.  In certain cases, such as when dealing with sudden cardiac arrest, a defibrillator might be necessary to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) can be used by trained individuals to deliver a shock if appropriate.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h5>This is the easiest way to remember the correct pattern of CPR</h5>
        </div><br>
    
    <div class="container">
            <h3>What to do when somebody's CHOKIN?</h3><br>
            <h5>Choking means when somebody is responsive but can't breathe. This is a result of a foreign object being accidentally in airway system. The universal sign of choking is when a person is clutching at the throat. What should we do for that?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Coughing. Encourage the person to cough if they are able to. Coughing is the body's natural way of trying to clear a blockage from the airway. If they are coughing effectively, encourage them to continue coughing to dislodge the object.</li><br>
                <li>H - Heimlich Maneuver. If the person is unable to cough, speak, or breathe, and shows signs of severe airway obstruction, you may need to perform the Heimlich maneuver (also known as abdominal thrusts). This involves standing behind the choking person, making a fist with one hand and placing the thumb side of your fist against the victim's abdomen, just above the navel and below the ribcage. Grasp your fist with your other hand and press into the abdomen with a quick upward thrust. Repeat until the object is dislodged or emergency help arrives.</li><br>
                <li>O - Observe. Continue to observe the person's condition. If the person becomes unconscious, immediately lower them to the ground and start CPR (beginning with chest compressions). Shout for help or call emergency services if you haven't already done so.</li><br>
                <li>K - Keep Assisting. Continue to assist the person until the obstruction is relieved or until emergency medical help arrives. If they become unconscious, begin CPR.</li><br>
                <li>I - Instruct Somebody to Call for Help. If you are the only person present, and the victim is still conscious but choking, instruct them to call emergency services or shout for help while you assist the person.</li><br>
                <li>N - Never Leave Alone. Ensure the choking victim is never left unattended until the situation is resolved or professional medical assistance arrives.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <h3>What are we doing in terms of Seizures?</h3><br>
            <h5>
                A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings, or consciousness. It occurs due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to a temporary disruption in normal brain function.<br><br>
                Seizures can vary widely in their presentation and effects. Some seizures may cause a person to stare blankly for a few seconds, while others can lead to uncontrollable movements, convulsions, or loss of consciousness.<br><br>Here are steps to follow when someone has a seizure:</h5><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure safety. Remove any sharp or harmful objects nearby to prevent injury to the person having the seizure. Cushion their head if they're on the ground to prevent head injuries.</li><br>
                <li>Time the seizure. Note the time the seizure starts. Seizures usually last for a few seconds to a few minutes. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, or if another seizure starts soon after the first, seek emergency medical help immediately.</li><br>
                <li>Protect the person: Keep the person safe by gently guiding them away from any potential danger. Do not restrain them or try to stop their movements. Allow the seizure to run its course. If you try to interfere with that person, not only this person will be seriously injured, but it will also injure you. So, along with the steps mentioned above, DO NOT TOUCH THAT PERSON!</li><br>
                <li>Positioning. If the person is on the ground, turn them onto their side to help keep their airway clear and prevent choking. Place something soft under their head, but do not try to hold them down or put anything in their mouth.</li><br>
                <li>Stay with them. Stay with the person until the seizure ends and they are fully conscious. Reassure them and speak calmly to them after the seizure ends.</li><br>
                <li>Check for medical ID. If the person has a medical bracelet or any form of identification indicating a history of seizures or specific medical needs, follow any instructions provided.</li><br>
                <li>And finally, Seek medical attention if necessary. Call for emergency medical assistance if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, if the person is injured, if it's their first seizure, if they're pregnant, or if they have difficulty breathing or recovering consciousness.</li><br>
            </ul>

        <h3>What about Wounds and Bleeding</h3><br>
        <h5>
            Bleeding is the process when blood escapes from blood vessels due to damage or injury. Subsequently, a body reacts to injury to prevent excessive blood loss and to initiate the body's healing process.<br><br>There are three types of bleeding: <br><strong>Capilary bleeding</strong>(Capillary bleeding is not a serious injury, as it involves small blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. It usually results in slow oozing of blood and is often seen in minor cuts and scrapes.), <br><strong>Venous bleeding</strong>(Venous bleeding happens when a vein is injured. Venous blood is darker and flows steadily rather than spurting. While it may not be as rapid as arterial bleeding, it still needs to be controlled.) <br>and <strong>Arterial bleeding</strong>(Arterial bleeding occurs when an artery is damaged. Arterial blood is bright red and tends to spurt or pulsate rhythmically with the heartbeat. This type of bleeding can be rapid and severe, requiring immediate attention to control the flow.)<br><br> In order to slow down and stop bleeding, a person must:</h5><hr><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess the situation. A person should determine the severity of the bleeding. Minor cuts may only ooze or trickle blood, while more severe injuries can result in heavy bleeding.</li><br>
            <li>Clean their hands. Before attending to the wound, a person <strong>must</strong> wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer to prevent introducing germs to the wound.</li><br>
            <li>Control bleeding. Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or sterile gauze. Maintain pressure until the bleeding stops. Elevate the injured area if possible to help reduce blood flow.</li><br>
            <li>Clean the wound. A person should gently clean the wound with mild soap and water to remove any dirt or debris. They should avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol as they can be irritating to the wound.</li><br>
            <li>Apply an antibiotic ointment. After cleaning, they should apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. Then they must cover the wound with a sterile bandage or dressing.</li><br>
            <li>Monitor for signs or infection. They <strong>must</strong> watch for increased redness, swelling, warmth, pain, or discharge from the wound. They should imediatelly seek medical attention if signs of infection develop.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Last thing to keep in mind:</h3><br>
        <h5>Remember that for every of the principles of first aid, make sure that it is already dialed to emergency service (112, 911, etc).
